For my chemistry extended essay, I am exploring the interesting topic of water potability and I am planning to do this by investigating the tap water of Singapore and Indonesia, as well as bottled water.\r\n\r\nThus, I attended the NEWater Visitor Centre yesterday to gain more insights regarding the water system in Singapore. I find it fascinating how Singapore uses such advanced technology and using 100% green energy to manage the water cycle here! As I pondered, here are some questions that arose in my mind: \r\n\u2022 For the 4 national water taps, are they all purified through the 3-Step Purification Process (Microfiltration/Ultrafiltration, Reverse Osmosis, and Ultraviolet Disinfection) or does only NEWater undergo that purification step? If the other national taps other than NEWater undergoes these processes, why can't NEWater be used as tap water for drinking (putting aside the fact that it is sometimes used if there is no rain for 4-5 weeks in Singapore and that the water supply is in a 'dangerous' level)?\r\n\u2022 I would like to ask from an expert's point of view on what you think are the most important factors in determining whether water is potable.

More details on the potable water treatment processes can be found in these links (Water Treatment  , Desalinated Water  ). Each method of treatment is customised to take into consideration the nature of the source water as well as its intended usage. Only NEWater undergoes the 3-step purification process (i.e. microfiltration/ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis and UV disinfection) to produce ultrapure water. This ultrapure water, clean to the point of being void of minerals found in potable water, is primarily used by high tech industries like wafer fabrication plants, data centres and district cooling systems.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith regard to potability, there are local and international standards and guidelines by which we may assess whether water is suitable for consumption. The most widely referred to standards are WHO\u2019s Guidelines for Drinking Water  , and US EPA\u2019s National Primary Drinking Water Standards  . In Singapore, we have our own drinking water regulations [Environmental Public Health (EPH) (Water Suitable for Drinking) (No. 2) Regulations 2019  ]. There are many parameters covered within the regulations, but they are generally categorised into microbiological and chemical standards/guidelines. For water to be potable, it must be free from pathogens, which can cause disease, as well as from any contaminating chemicals, which can cause both acute toxic effects as well as longer term chronic conditions. The physico-chemical measurements (such as pH) should also be within the stipulated range/levels.

PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) are emerging drinking water quality parameters for which no health-based values are currently specified in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality. The WHO is expected to conduct scientific reviews of PFAS in drinking water, before publication of its revised Guidelines, as per its work plan. Regarding the presence of PFAS in drinking water supplies, Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is monitoring the reports published in the USA and EU in the recent years. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has not included PFAS in its National Drinking Water Regulation. Nonetheless, it has established non-regulatory human health advisories for certain PFAS compounds in drinking water, and released interim and finalized advisories for those compounds in Jun 2022.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.           In Singapore, the Schedule of the Environmental Public Health (Water Suitable for Drinking) (No. 2) Regulations stipulates a set of drinking water quality standards, which takes reference from the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality. To seek scientific advice on the review of these standards, SFA has established a Technical Committee on National Drinking Water Quality Standards, which consists of a panel of multidisciplinary experts. Although PFAS standards are not currently specified in the Schedule of the Regulations, SFA will continue to monitor international guidelines including those established by US EPA and EU, and scientific developments on health effects of PFAS in drinking water, in consideration of the review and establishment of new standards, as per the expert advice of the Technical Committee. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a PUB assistant generating standardized, formal, confident water quality email replies."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Dear [REDACTED],\n\n\r\nI would like to express my sincere appreciation for the excellent water supply in Singapore. The water quality is top-notch, and I am grateful for the efforts made by the government to ensure the safety and health of all residents. The amount of responsibility and care shown towards the people is divine.\r\nThis is also the major reason on insisting me to write the below\r\n\r\nHaving lived here for six months, I would like to offer a small suggestion for consideration please. Kindly note that the below are based on my personal experiences and what I have seen through my eyes. This is just a kind of care that I thought I can show from my end for others :)\r\n\r\nFor the hair and skin :\r\nI wash my hair every two days once. Using the RO water for hair wash gives a very soft and shiny texture. It is so pleasant to have such silky hair after the wash. But I also noticed adverse hair fall and it started thinning quickly while days passed by. \r\nAt first, I thought this could be because of my type of hair or skin, as I have experiences of using RO water previously for few years which resulted the same. But when I started to notice other people's hair density, (both foreigners and Singaporeans) I felt like most of the people's scalp were thin too. It starts to thin at the peak head first.\r\nPeople who were at the young ages(between 20 and 30) had a better density but when they are nearing even early 30s I felt most of them started to have thin hair. \r\nSame goes with the cute kids too. They have a very thin hair as far as I have seen for most of them.\r\n\r\nAnd for the skin, I feel that moisture is very important to keep our skin healthy and young. People who are elderly here have sagging/wrinkled skin. While I understand that these are due to aging which is a natural process but I feel its attained a little early.\r\n\r\nFor instance, my mother who is 57 years old doesn't have sagging or wrinkles yet but when I compare the same aged auntie here, she has sagging and wrinkles. \r\n\r\nI feel that using RO water for daily activities may strip away essential minerals, iron, and moisture that are crucial for healthy hair and skin. Perhaps it would be worth exploring alternative ways to purify and filter water without resorting to RO treatment for non-drinking water usage, such as bathing, washing clothes, and toilet use.\r\n\r\nMy kind suggestion would be to consider having a dedicated tap(the kitchen tap may be) for the purest drinking water and just filtering the rest of the water for other usages. This approach may help to reduce costs and improve overall health by promoting healthy skin and hair.\r\n\r\nThis may typically reduce the expenses on making the water undergo so much process which could be a big saving too.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your commitment to providing excellent water quality and ensuring the well-being of everyone.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\n[REDACTED SIGN-OFF]\r\nSridevi Sureshkumar\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFiled to PUBWiki  \r\n\r\n[PUBWiki:0035D_00048I:EID]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dear [REDACTED],\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\n[REDACTED SIGN-OFF]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe would like to clarify that PUB's tap water supply is mainly from the treatment of local catchment water and imported water, which does not involve the Reverse Osmosis (RO) process for treatment.

In a subsequent email I will focus on the contribution of solar panels in adding lead to the environment. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe encounter anthropogenic lead every day in our work, in public places, at homes, in places of recreation, children's playground, on roads, in our waterways, in the soil and in the air we breathe, and of course the food we consume. According to the peered reviewed publication of the  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) titled The Toxicological Profile of Lead, \"(p)articulate matter containing Pb (chemical symbol for lead) can be transported through air, water, and soil. In general, atmospheric deposition is the largest source of Pb found in soils not impacted by other local non-air sources (e.g., dust from deteriorating leaded paint). Pb is transferred continuously between air, water, and soil by natural chemical and physical processes such as weathering, runoff, precipitation, dry deposition of dust, and stream/river flow; however, soil and sediments appear to be important sinks for Pb.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe multifarious pathways for lead to reach our brain, lung, liver, heart and bones are via the environment, as dust in the air we breathe, the soil and waterways to our water source and the plants we and domesticated animals eat.  According to the US Centre of Disease Control (CDC), some studies have found lead can be absorbed through skin.  \"If you handle lead and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, you could be exposed. Lead dust can also get on your clothes and your hair. If this happens, it\u2019s possible that you may track home some of the lead dust, which may also expose your family.\" \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the intermittent nature of wind and solar power, a large part of the energy it generates has to be stored in batteries. Up to half of all batteries end up in the illegal establishments, \u201cwhere unregulated and often illegal recycling operations break open battery cases, spilling acid and lead dust onto the ground, and smelt lead in open-air furnaces that spew toxic fumes and dust that contaminate surrounding neighborhoods,\u201d according to a report published in July by Pure Earth and UNICEF, the UN children\u2019s agency. The damage to the flora and fauna and mankind is hard to manage. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEven if lead is found in compounds manufactured decades ago, it is still harmful. Lead poisoning is particularly prevalent in steel bridge maintenance and replacement programs. The US CDC in 1992 recommended mandating all new contracts for Federal, State, and local departments of transportation to include a program to protect workers from \"lead poisoning during the maintenance, repainting, or demolition of bridges and other steel structures.\"  (Note. In Singapore asbestos management is recognised as hazardous but the same cannot be said regarding the maintenance and disposal of painted structures.  As a global center of ship repairing, it is disconcerting to note that the practice of removing degraded paint and repainting of ships largely ignores the risk of lead exposure.)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLead affects men, women and children. According to multiple reputable sources, the poison is cumulative, gets absorbed in our blood, and accumulates in our bones and teeth. Lead in the blood of a pregnant woman is potentially harmful to her developing foetus. Because it accumulates in our body, no level of exposure to lead over time is known to be without harmful effects. Young children are particularly vulnerable as they absorb lead more readily.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2014, CDC tested 12 children in Houston County for lead poisoning, which it defines as kids who have more than 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood. Seven of those tests came back positive.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow much lead is too much?  \"Just 4 ug/dl (micrograms per deciliter) can double your risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke, and similar levels may also cause memory loss.\" according to Professor Eliseo Guallar, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. This is miniscule compared to the amount of lead found in an average solar panel.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe disorders that can arise from lead poisoning are extensively discussed in the voluminous publication by ASDR, mentioned above which is freely accessible online.  Here we summarise these: \r\n\r\nNeurological Effects.\r\n\r\no Children. Decreased cognitive function; altered mood and behaviors that may contribute\r\n\r\nto learning deficits, altered neuromotor and neurosensory function, peripheral\r\n\r\nneuropathy, and encephalopathy.\r\n\r\no Adults. Decreased cognitive function including attention, memory, and learning; altered neuromotor and neurosensory function; altered mood and behavior; and decreased peripheral nerve conduction velocity.\r\n\r\nRenal Effects. Decreased GFR, proteinuria, enzymuria, impaired tubular transport, and histopathological damage.\r\n\r\nCardiovascular Effects. Increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased risk of hypertension, atherosclerosis, altered cardiac conduction, increased risk of heart disease, and increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease.\r\n\r\nHematological Effects. Inhibition of \u00e4-ALAD leading to decreased blood hemoglobin and anemia, decreased activity of other erythrocyte enzymes, and altered plasma erythropoietin (EPO) levels.\r\n\r\nImmunological Effects. Perturbation of humoral and cell-mediated immune systems, decreased resistance to disease, sensitization, autoimmunity, and inflammation.\r\n\r\nReproductive Effects:\r\n\r\n     o Males. Effects on sperm, alterations in semen quality, decreased fertility, histopathological damage to the testes, and possible altered serum concentrations of reproductive hormones.\r\n\r\n    o Females. Possible alterations in serum concentrations of reproductive hormones, decreased fertility, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and earlier age at the onset of menopause.\r\n\r\nDevelopmental Effects. Decreased birth weight and size, decreased anthropometric measures in children, and delayed onset of puberty in males and females.\r\n\r\nOther health outcomes associated with PbB include the following:\r\n\r\nRespiratory Effects. Decreased lung function, increased bronchial hyperreactivity, increased risk of asthma, and obstructive lung disease.\r\n\r\nHepatic Effects. Possible increases in plasma liver enzymes and cholesterol, enlarged liver, and increased thickness of gallbladder wall.\r\n\r\nEndocrine Effects. Possible alterations in serum of thyroid hormones, altered cortisol responses, alteration in serum growth factors, and decreased serum vitamin D levels.\r\n\r\nGastrointestinal Effects. Abdominal pain/colic, nausea, vomiting, and  diarrhoea and/or constipation.\r\n\r\nMusculoskeletal Effects. Bone loss, osteoporosis, dental caries, tooth loss, and periodontitis.\r\n\r\nOcular Effects. Possible macular degeneration and cataracts.\r\n\r\nCancer Increased risk of cancer, including all cancers, cancer of the respiratory tract, intestinal tract, and larynx, and glioma.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAttempts to whitewash the presence of lead or its risk to human kind is best illustrated by the battle between Clair Patterson and Robert Kehoe. Kehoe, a medical doctor. I quote from an article in April 2014 in Science Blog:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Patterson was an expert in analyzing trace elements; Kehoe was a doctor who was in the pocket of the petroleum industry. Patterson saw rising levels of lead in the environment as a consequence of its use as a fuel additive; Kehoe was getting paid to sow doubt. Patterson focused on the effects of environmental lead on human health; Kehoe was more concerned with the profit margins of industry.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPatterson testified before congress, and really chewed out industry and Kehoe for their misappropriation of science.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, from the history of development of the lead pollution problem in the United States that responsible and regulatory persons and organizations concerned in this matter have failed to distinguish between scientific activity and the utilization of observations for material purpose. [such utilization] is not science\u2026it is the defense and promotion of industrial activity. This utilization is not done objectively. It is done subjectively. \u2026 It is not just a mistake for public health agencies to cooperate and collaborate with industries in investigating and deciding whether public health is endangered\u2014it is a direct abrogation and violation of the duties and responsibilities of those public health organizations. In the past, these bodies have acted as though their own activities and those of lead industries in health matters were science, and they could be considered objectively in that sense.\r\n\r\n\"Clair Patterson (a geochemist) is credited with being the first person to mount an effective challenge against the Kehoe paradigm   (Show me the Data), and with his success came an upsurge of activity and attention to the risks of environmental lead pollution on public health.\"  (Note 1. The remark \"It is not just a mistake for public health agencies to cooperate and collaborate with industries in investigating and deciding whether public health is endangered\u2014it is a direct abrogation and violation of the duties and responsibilities of those public health organizations,\" is worth remembering as it applies equally to all projects including the subject of my complaint. Note 2. Patterson's battle against lead pollution, interestingly, did not start off as such. He was in fact trying to precisely determine the age of planet Earth but in so doing he was frustrated by the amount of lead pollution \"everywhere\" which interfered with his experiments.)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLeaded petrol has polluted the planet so much lead particulates are found in every corner of the world, carried by wind and waves across oceans.  The UN Environmental Program estimates the \"official\" end of (its) use will prevent more than 1.2 million premature deaths and save USD 2.45 trillion a year[{SS}]. Leaded petrol was characterised by the UN as \"one of the most serious threats to human health.\"   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLead can be deadly to an entire civilization. Many historians are inclined to attribute the fall of the Roman Empire to the extensive use by the nobility of products in which lead was present.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nClair Patterson's crusade against leaded petrol has taught us lessons we should never forget:\r\n\r\n1.\tOne should critically examine all innovations that could impact global health risks.\r\n2.\tEspecially pernicious are toxicants invisible to the naked eye that are transported through air, soil and water to the human race.\r\n3.\tOne should never be afraid to challenge overwhelming public opinion.\r\n4.\tManufacturers have deep pockets to fund quasi-research that is funnelled to authorities regulating the industry (a practice entrenched in the drug, tobacco  and oil industries.)\r\n5.\tIt is for authorities and regulators to conduct independent research \r\n\r\nSolar panels and batteries could replicate the lead poisoning in which millions of men, women, children and unborn babies have suffered, some fatally, by an indiscernible cause.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDoubtlessly there will be enormously more solar panels in the world than vehicles in the next few decades. One may expect photovoltaic-linked lead poisoning to be a bigger issue than tetraethyl lead (to give the latter its technical name).The lead used in both the panels and batteries will be all around us for decades. As they degrade, lead will find the pathways to and accumulate in human bodies. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWorse still, the millions of end-of-life panels and batteries will be discarded in the open or in landfills, oceans, or recycled in factories or incinerated. Whatever the means of disposal it will result in more anthropogenic lead in our body.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor two hundred years we congratulate ourselves as more power stations come on line to improve our lives. As a result we have unwittingly destabilised the climate.  In attempting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we are running the risk of poisoning ourselves with toxins which will bioaccumulate in our organs and will not become apparent for several decades as we have seen in the case of tetraethyllead.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLim Soon Heng BE, PE, FIMarEST, FSFSS\r\n\r\nFounding President / Senior Advisor\r\n\r\nSociety of FLOATING SOLUTIONS (Singapore)  \r\n\r\nUEN: T17SS0238L\r\n\r\n12-07, Temasek Boulevard, Tower 1, Suntec City, Singapore [REDACTED POSTAL]\r\n\r\nCell/Whats App [REDACTED PHONE]\r\n\r\n#12-07 Suntec City Tower 1\r\n\r\nSingapore [REDACTED POSTAL]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Message Classification: Restricted\r\n\r\nHi [REDACTED],\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEmail below for your info.

Previous epidemiological studies had shown positive relationship between aluminum in drinking water and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, although there have been studies that showed no relationship between the two. Owing to inconclusiveness of the various studies on aluminum\u2019s impact on health, WHO has only developed a health-based target and aesthetic target for aluminum rather than a guideline value."}]}

To safeguard public health, it is a requirement for water fittings such as taps/mixers (basin, sink/bib and shower), flushing cisterns, pipes, pipe fittings, amongst others, to be tested for compliance to PUB\u2019s stipulated standards before they can be sold and installed in Singapore. This ensures that the water fittings do not have any adverse impact on water quality, cause water contamination or lead to water wastage and are reliable/durable. Additionally, for taps/mixers, flushing cisterns and flush valves, these products shall be registered under the Mandatory Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (MWELS). Suppliers shall ensure that the water fittings are supported with test reports and WELS labels before supplying in Singapore. At point-of-installation, the Licensed Plumber shall ensure his due diligence that the water fittings installed are compliant and that the water quality complies with PUB\u2019s requirements.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.            We would also like to highlight that the building owner/MCST is ultimately fully responsible for the proper maintenance and security of the water service installations within their premises (e.g. water storage tanks, pumps and service pipes), and ensuring that the building\u2019s water quality remains wholesome. As part of the maintenance regime, the building owner is required to engage a Licensed Plumber to inspect, clean and certify the water storage tanks annually to ensure that they are fit and safe for the storage of potable water.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.            To ensure the safety of the drinking water supply, PUB has a comprehensive sampling and monitoring programme from the source to the tap.

I assume that the team is referring to the diversion of the nutrient-rich surface runoff to the below-ground surface. In this case, the team will need to consider the feasibility of this solution as often the amount of water for surface runoff is huge, the proposed nutrient tank will likely be filled up quickly and then overflown. How does the team intend to divert a large volume of nutrient-rich runoff water? The team will also need to consider the infiltration rate of the soil. How fast the \u2018nutrient-rich runoff water\u2019 can be infiltrated into the ground (usually the process is not fast enough to cope with the large amount of runoff). Another point to consider would be the potential contamination of groundwater with the nutrient-rich water. The diversion of surface water to the below-ground to become groundwater may not fully solve the nutrient issue as the nutrient-rich groundwater will still find its way to nearby watercourses when possible. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.\tProposed solution 2: Cure\r\n\r\nIt is unclear how iron, aluminium and hydrogen peroxide are refilled into Cure. Does the team intend to remove phosphorus from water using iron and aluminium through precipitation? The team may need to consider other influencing factors (e.g. pH, oxygen level) and water retention time required for chemical reactions to take place within the machine. As for hydrogen peroxide, is it meant to oxidise organic phosphorus? For the partially permeable membrane (depending on pore size/membrane properties), particulate phosphorus will likely be filtered and dissolved phosphorus will pass through the membrane. Perhaps the team can be more specific on which fractions of phosphorus the machine is targeted. Membrane fouling/trapping debris in front of the membrane can also be an operational issue to address during the design. Lastly, the team needs to look at a proper sizing of this treatment system to cope with a huge volume of surface runoff. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.\tProposed solution 3: T3\r\n\r\nIt is worth highlighting that algal cells are very small in size and algal scum can disperse easily into water. This may be difficult for Tsunam machine to push algal scum to Tornade for collection. Also, harmful algal blooms may produce toxins, which are unlikely suitable for animal feed/fertilisers. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHope the comments are useful for the team\u2019s continuous research and wish you all the best for the project.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nGrace\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDr Chan Wai Sum (Grace)\r\n\r\nLead Specialist (Raw Water System)\r\n\r\n[REDACTED ROLE/ORG]\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na: WaterHub 82 Toh Guan Road East #C2-12/13 S([REDACTED POSTAL])\r\n\r\nt: [REDACTED PHONE]\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSent: Thursday, July 27, 2023 12:54 PM\r\nTo: NEA Contact (NEA) <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\r\nCc: [REDACTED EMAIL]\r\nSubject: Request for Online or Email Interview with NEA (National Environmental Agency) regarding Group Project on GCT3 for GCE \u2018A\u2019 Level Project Work\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDear [REDACTED],\n\r\n\r\nWe are a group of students from Jurong Pioneer Junior College and are currently working on our GCE \u2018A\u2019 Level Project Work.

Oxidizable organic compounds react, reducing the dichromate ion (Cr2O72\u0096) to green chromic ion (Cr3+). For low concentration samples, the amount of Cr6+ that remains is measured. For high concentration samples, the amount of Cr3+ that is produced is measured.

The government said it is the best way to deal with tritium and trace amounts of other radionuclides in the water.\r\n\r\n\"Releasing the treated water into the sea is a realistic solution,\" Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a Cabinet meeting endorsing the plan. \"We will do our utmost to keep the water far above safety standards.\" A Japanese government official later clarified that details of the release need to be worked out and approved. Gradual, trial releases could start in 2 years and might take 40 years to complete.\r\n\r\nIndustry groups and nuclear scientists say other nuclear plants have disposed of wastewater this way with minimal impacts. But environmental groups, fisheries organizations, and neighboring countries immediately condemned the decision, citing the vast amounts involved. Marine scientists expressed concerns about the possible impact of the discharge on marine life and on fisheries.\r\n\r\nThe announcement was long anticipated  . Three nuclear reactors at the Fukushima plant suffered meltdowns in the wake of an earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. Molten fuel debris burned through steel containment vessels and into the concrete bases of the reactor buildings. Ever since, workers have pumped water through the ruins to prevent the debris from overheating and causing further damage. They have also collected all the contaminated water: It now fills more than 1000 steel tanks crammed onto the Fukushima campus.\r\n\r\nThe only practical options for disposing of the water \"are discharge into the sea and vapor release, both of which have preceding practices,\" concluded a governmental advisory committee made up of academics and citizen group representatives in February 2020. Nuclear power plants the world over regularly release water containing trace amounts of tritium into the environment under monitored and controlled conditions. And vaporization ultimately took care of about 9000 tons of contaminated water resulting from the accident at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in March 1979. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \"considers the disposal options as technically feasible and in line with international practice,\" IAEA [REDACTED ROLE/ORG]\n\r\nTokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) runs the water through a complex chain of filters it calls the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS). The treatment captures 62 kinds of radionuclides, but not tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a 12.3-year half-life that occurs naturally in trace amounts in seawater and the atmosphere. It is extremely difficult to remove as it replaces hydrogen atoms in water molecules. Because tritium emits only low-energy beta particles, it poses a modest health risk. And the plan is to dilute the water until the tritium concentration is one-fortieth of what Japan allows in drinking water.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough \"the optics are terrible,\" releasing the water into the Pacific Ocean is the right thing to do, says Nigel Marks, a nuclear materials scientist at Curtin University, in a statement released by the Australian Science Media Centre. By diluting, the \"radioactivity can be reduced to safe levels\" comparable to exposures from medical imaging and airline travel, he says.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to tritium, more dangerous isotopes with longer radioactive lifetimes, such as ruthenium, cobalt, strontium, and plutonium, sometimes slip through the ALPS process, something TEPCO only acknowledged in 2018. The company now says these additional nuclides are present in 71% of the tanks. \"These radioactive isotopes behave differently than tritium in the ocean and are more readily incorporated into marine biota or seafloor sediments,\" says Ken Buesseler, a marine chemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.\r\n\r\nThe government official says the Fukushima water will be \"repurified\" to meet regulatory standards for these nuclides. Buesseler notes that those limits were put in place for operational nuclear power plants, not for the deliberate release of contaminated water from a nuclear disaster. \"Would this open the door for any country to release radioactive waste to the ocean that is not part of normal operations?\" he asks.\r\n\r\nShigeyoshi Otosaka, a marine geochemist at the University of Tokyo, worries about the accumulation of the isotopes in seafloor sediments, where they can get picked up by marine biota. The possibility is limited, \"but it's important to evaluate it appropriately,\" he says. For one thing, the TEPCO \"repurification\" has only been tested on a small volume of water. The company needs to verify \"whether the processing performance can be maintained for a long period of time,\" he says.\r\n\r\nAlthough TEPCO claims it will run out of room to store additional water by the middle of 2022, environmental organizations say there is space for additional tanks on land adjacent to the Fukushima campus. That storage would allow the radioactive isotopes to naturally decay while buying time to develop new treatment techniques.\r\n\r\nAny additional release of radiation will come on top of the estimated 538.1 petabecquerels of radioactivity emitted into the atmosphere by the explosions that blew apart the three reactor buildings in the days after the earthquake. That amount was about one-tenth of the estimated radiation released by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986. The Fukushima radiation had a minimal impact on humans, though the precautionary evacuations did cause unexpected social and health problems  .\r\n\r\nMuch of the radioactive material fell into the Pacific Ocean because of prevailing winds. Concerns over contaminated fish devastated the regional fishing industry. Demand for seafood from the region has gradually recovered, but fisheries officials fear releasing contaminated water will rekindle public fears about seafood from the region."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dear [REDACTED],\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\n[REDACTED SIGN-OFF]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDesalinated water is one of PUB's four national taps, and is supplied to the population for potable use.

We wish to inform you that we have received feedback from members of the public that your website contains information suggesting that PUB water is not safe for human consumption. We have sent several advisories on 8 May 2020 and 25 Feb 2020 to Bodyluv.sg to remove all misleading information or false claims that state PUB water is unsafe for drinking in your Facebook postings.  However, the Facebook postings as shown below give a false sense that PUB water is not safe for human consumption and usage. Please remove all misleading information or false claims that state/imply that PUB water is unsafe for drinking and usage immediately.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.          We would like to highlight again that PUB has put in place a comprehensive and robust sampling and monitoring programme from source to tap to ensure that water supplied is safe for consumption. We would like to assure you that the quality of PUB drinking water is well within WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality and Singapore Environmental Public Health (Water Suitable for Drinking) (No.2) Regulations (EPH) 2019. The drinking water supplied by PUB is safe for drinking without the need for any point-of-use water treatment or filtering devices to further treat.  The quality of the water is also independently checked by the [REDACTED ROLE/ORG]\n\r\n4.          You are again strongly advised to review all your Facebook postings, videos and brochures and ensure that you do not employ scare tactics to promote your products.

Ms Wan also shared that she had moved to her current residence early this year and did not observe any white residue after boiling the tap water using the same kettle in her previous place of residence at West Coast.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInvestigation and findings\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2        On 22 June 2022, our officers visited Ms Wan\u2019s premises upon receiving her feedback via PUBOne and were shown the white residue accumulated at the base of her kettle. We shared with Ms Wan that mineral salts like calcium carbonate found naturally in our water supply may precipitate over time after boiling the water and can form the white residues at the base of the kettle. With proper and adequate maintenance, accumulation of minerals on appliances as observed in the kettle can be easily removed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3       Our officer conducted in-situ testing of the water sample collected from her tap and results were satisfactory. To further assure her on the quality of the water supply to her premises, we proceeded to collect water samples from our watermain, customer\u2019s meter position and kitchen tap for laboratory analysis. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4       The laboratory test results showed that water quality was well within the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality and Environmental Public Health (Water Suitable for Drinking) (No.2) Regulations, 2019. Depending on the source of the treated water, the hardness of the water will vary from supply zone to supply zone and are typically higher in Nanyang Service Reservoir (NYSR) supply zone. The measured total hardness (as CaCO3) of the water samples taken from Ms Wan\u2019s premises ranged between 80-94mg/L, typical of NYSR supply zone water and is considered moderately hard water. On 4 July 2022, we sent an email reply to Ms Wan to explain that water quality test results are satisfactory and assured her water is safe for consumption.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5       Upon receiving Ms Wan\u2019s feedback through Minister, we contacted her again on 11 Aug 2022 to explain the findings. She explained that she may have missed our earlier email reply dated 4 July 2022 because it was in her email\u2019s junk folder. She acknowledged and noted our clarification.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6       Our proposed reply to Ms Wan is for CE\u2019s approval, please. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDear [REDACTED],\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe refer to your feedback (Ref No.: 22/08/04/A8-2/BOONLAY/D) dated 4 August 2022, through Minister Desmond Lee, Advisor for Jurong GRC regarding white residue accumulating in your water kettle after boiling of tap water, and your request for the laboratory test results for the water samples collected during our site investigations at your premises on 22 June and 1 July 2022. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2       As indicated in our earlier email reply to you dated 4 July 2022, laboratory test results collected from the watermain, meter position and your kitchen tap were satisfactory.

Upon further clarifications with the authors and researchers, we were informed that they had used modelled estimates of disease exposure driven mostly by the Global Burden of Disease\u2019s Socio-demographic Index for Singapore and data from other countries in the High-Income Asia region rather than actual health data from Singapore. PUB had urged the authors to refer to WHO/UNICEF\u2019s Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene where 100% of Singapore\u2019s population is using safely managed drinking water services. Moving forward, PUB will continue to engage the authors and researchers of the EPI report and to share data on our actual water quality to shape the modelling assumptions to reflect Singapore\u2019s 100% safely managed drinking water services in future iterations of the report accurately.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you have further clarifications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\n[REDACTED SIGN-OFF]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\n[REDACTED SIGN-OFF]\r\n\r\nCHANG Siao Yun\r\n\r\nFor [REDACTED ROLE/ORG]\n\r\nDeputy [REDACTED ROLE/ORG]\n\r\n[REDACTED ROLE/ORG]\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na: 82, Toh Guan Road East, #C2-12/13, Waterhub S([REDACTED POSTAL])\r\n\r\nt: [REDACTED PHONE]"}]}
