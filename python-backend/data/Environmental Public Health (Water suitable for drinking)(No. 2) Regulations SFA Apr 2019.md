 (3) Where a water provider is subject to this Part under paragraph (1)(a), the water provider is subject to this Part only in relation to the provision of water by the system that produces water suitable for drinking.
 (4) In this regulation, “produce”, in relation to water suitable for drinking, means converting non-potable water into water suitable for drinking.

 Water safety plan
 6.—(1) A WSSP water provider must not provide any water suitable for drinking unless the WSSP water provider has in place a water safety plan that is prepared by the WSSP water provider, in accordance with the code of practice, and approved by the Director-General, for —

 (ii) any other place allowed by the Director-General.

 (4) In deciding whether to allow a test to be carried out at any other place under paragraph (3)(c)(ii), the Director-General must consider whether the time taken to carry out the test in a testing laboratory may cause the test results to be unreliable.
