      <h2>Project Scope/Background</h2>
      <p>At Public Utilities Board (PUB), Singapore’s National Water Agency's Water Quality Department (WQD), we conduct water quality tests to ensure the safety of Singapore's water supply system. Besides testing works, we also take the lead to front internal and external water quality issues. We spend a considerable amount of time replying to queries involving water quality issues. Although we receive an average of 1-2 queries per day, we do not have a dedicated team to respond to these queries.</p>
      <p>We conducted a review and determined that most of these queries fall under a few themes: (1) water quality parameters in the regulations and our water supply, (2) water quality testing, (3) potential collaborators, and (4) enquiry on the treatment technologies in PUB.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>We plan to implement a Large Language Model (LLM) to draft responses to water quality issues. The main idea is to reduce manhours and free up our staff to handle more complex/critical inquiries. A typical customer response takes around 4 manhours to draft and clear. With the Generative AI (GenAI) chatbot, turnaround time will be reduced to an average of 2 hours.</p>
      <p>The data source includes: (1) water quality data from regulations and (2) SFA regulatory requirements, as well as an email archive. This chatbot aims to provide grammatically correct and contextually accurate draft replies for proofreading.</p>
